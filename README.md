# CustomCommandDemo (AKA Barcoder)
If all you do is run this demo, you'll see that it merely lets you open an image
and then flip it horizontally or vertically.

However, under the hood, you'll see that instead of just using DotImages built
in and very capable FlipCommand class, we're actually doing the work inside
CustomFlipCommand.

What is this CustomFlipCommand? It's an example of inheriting our base
ImageCommand and using it to build your own. Using the PixelAccessor and
PixelMemory classes, we're directly manipulating the underlying pixels that make
up the image. What we end up doing is simply rearranging the image, flipping
horizontally or vertically... what you do with it is left up to your
imagination.

The PixelAccessor and PixelMemory objects are certainly available outside of the
ImageCommand structure, but by implementing this as an ImageCommand, you can now
use your CustomImageCommand anywhere you would use any of our existing
ImageCommand classes.

This is the VB.NET version. We also offer a [C# version](https://github.(mailto:sales@atalasoft.com)/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_CustomCommandDemo_CS_x64).


## Licensing
This application requires a license for DotImage Document Imaging. If you wish to have PDF support, you can add our PdfReader addon licensing. You may also request a 30 day evaulation if youre evaluating if DotImage / our OCR is right for you.  


## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2.0.0. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2022. You must have our SDK installed (and licesed per above).  

[Download DotImage](https://www.atalasoft.(mailto:sales@atalasoft.com)/BeginDownload/DotImageDownloadPage)  


### Using NuGet for SDK Dependencies
We do publish our SDK components to NuGet. We have chosen to base the demo on local installed SDK because this leads to much smaller applications (NuGet packages add a lot of overhead due to the way they're packaged and deployed, and many of our demos -- including this one -- are often used to reproduce issues that need to be submitted to support. Apps that use NuGet are often significantly larger and run up against our maximum support case upload size).  

Still, if you wish to use NuGet for the dependencies instead of relying on locally installed SDK, you can.
